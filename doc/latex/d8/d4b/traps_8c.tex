Address error trap.

This function is called when an address error occurs. That means that a call address of a function or in the stack addresses an area outside the memory. Similarly, if a pointer points to memory outside the range, this trap happens.

Stack error trap.

This function is called when an stack error occurs. That means that the stack pointer, stack pointer limit, or frame pointer are pointing outside their range.

Math error trap.

This function is called when an math error occurs. That means an illegal math operation was performed (such as division by 0 or Na\+N).

Alternative Oscillator fail trap.

This function is called when an oscillator fail occurs. This should never happen.

Alternative address error trap.

This function is called when an address error occurs. That means that a call address of a function or in the stack addresses an area outside the memory. Similarly, if a pointer points to memory outside the range, this trap happens.

Alternative stack error trap.

This function is called when an stack error occurs. That means that the stack pointer, stack pointer limit, or frame pointer are pointing outside their range.

Alternative math error trap.

This function is called when an math error occurs. That means an illegal math operation was performed (such as division by 0 or Na\+N).

Default interrupt service routine.

This function is called when no other interrupt routine is specified.
