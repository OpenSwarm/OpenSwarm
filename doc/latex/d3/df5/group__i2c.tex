Inter-\/\+Integrated Circuit bus is a multi-\/master, multi-\/slave, serial bus (see also \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C}{\tt https\+://en.\+wikipedia.\+org/wiki/\+I\%\+C2\%\+B2\+C} )

Open\+Swarm organises processes in three lists of processes (pid sorted)\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item running list\+: includes all processes are ready to be executed and are scheduled according to the scheduling algorithm.
\item blocked list\+: includes all processes that are waiting for events to occur.
\item Zombie list\+: includes all processes that are about to be terminated but not deleted yet.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{group__i2c_i2c_usage}{}\subsection{Usage}\label{group__i2c_i2c_usage}
T\+He I2\+C interface can be initialised and started with Sys\+\_\+\+Init\+\_\+\+I2\+C and Sys\+\_\+\+Start\+\_\+\+I2\+C respectively. Similarly, it can be paused, continued, or stopped by Sys\+\_\+\+Pause\+\_\+\+I2\+C, Sys\+\_\+\+Contine\+\_\+\+I2\+C, or Sys\+\_\+\+Stop\+\_\+\+I2\+C respectively. While the interface is running, data can be written with Sys\+\_\+\+I2\+C\+\_\+\+Sent\+Bytes. Values can be read with Sys\+\_\+\+I2\+C\+\_\+\+Read where the request message has also to be specified.

\begin{DoxyRefDesc}{Todo}
\item[\hyperlink{todo__todo000006}{Todo}]testing and debugging of this module.\end{DoxyRefDesc}


\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This module is currently untested. Might doesn\textquotesingle{}t work or includes some bugs. The interrupt handler \+\_\+\+M\+I2\+C\+Interrupt is also out commented, because it might interfere with the e-\/\+Puck library used in the camera module.
