 * \brief The frequency recognizer using FFT
 * \section sect1 Introduction
 * The runfftlistener programm is made to illustrate how you can use the
 * FFT package of the library. The goal is to determine the frequency of
 * the sound comming from the microphone number 0. If the frequency is 
 * under 900Hz the e-puck will turn left. If the frequency is between
 * 900Hz and 1800Hz the e-puck will go forward. If the frequency is over
 * 1800Hz the e-puck will turn right.
 * 
 * \section sect2 Playing the demo
 * First of all, move the selector to the position 9 to 15 and reset the e-puck.
 * To play the demo, you have two allternatives:
 * - You are a good whistler. In this case you can drive the e-puck with
 * your mouse by whistling in the good frequency.
 * - You do not know whistlering. In this case you can play the "sound1.mp3"
 * or "sound2.mp3" which are in the folder "demo" to drive the e-puck.
 *
