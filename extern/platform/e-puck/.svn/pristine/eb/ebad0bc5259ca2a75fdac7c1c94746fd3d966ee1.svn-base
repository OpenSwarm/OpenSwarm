 * \brief Obstacles follower/avoider
 * \section sect1 Introduction
 * This demo is made to illustrate how to use the 8 proximities sensors.
 * \n The demo is divided in two programms:
 * - A programm to follow what is detected on the front of the e-puck
 * (for exemple another e-puck).
 * - A programm to avoid the obstacles.
 * 
 * These two programms work exactelly on the same way. First we do the
 * acquisition of the proxymities sensor and then we do a level-headed
 * sum of this acquisition. Finally we set the speed in concordance of
 * the level-headed sum.
 *
 * \section sect2 Playing the demo
 * \subsection subsect1 Playing the follower
 * First of all, move the selector to the position 4 and reset the e-puck.
 * The e-puck will go forward until he meets anything (it works good with
 * fingers or another e-puck). After that he will
 * follow him by staying always on the same distance.
 * \subsection subsect2 Playing the avoider
 * First of all, move the selector to the position 5 and reset the e-puck.
 * The e-puck will go forward until he meets an obstacle. At this time he
 * will find the better way to avoid him.
