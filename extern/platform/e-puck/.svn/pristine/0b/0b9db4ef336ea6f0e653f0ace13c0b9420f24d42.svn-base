 * \brief The shocks detector
 * \section sect1 Introduction
 * This demo uses the acceleromter to detect the direction of the shocks
 * enduring by the e-puck.
 * \n When the e-puck has deteced a shock, he plays a sound and show you
 * the direction of this shock by turning on the appropriated LED.
 * 
 * \section sect2 Playing the demo
 * First of all, move the selector to the position 0 and reset the e-puck.
 * \n Then you only have to hit the e-puck and a LED will turn on to
 * show you the direction of the shock that the e-puck has detected. The
 * e-puck will also play a sound.
 * \n If you let the e-puck falling, he detects the "zero_G" and beginn to
 * cry.
